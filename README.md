# PositionSizer
An Open-Source basic calculator for Risk and Position Sizing


## To Do:
### 1. Consistent use of f-strings: 
 - Utilize f-string formatting consistently throughout the codebase for improved readability and string interpolation.
 ### 2. Validate user input: 
- Implement input validation for numerical inputs such as account size, account risk, trade risk, and ticker quantity to handle invalid values or non-numeric characters.
### 3. Error handling: 
- Enhance error handling by raising exceptions or implementing appropriate error handling mechanisms when fetching price data for tickers to provide informative feedback to the user.
### 4. Modularize functions: 
- Consider modularizing functions into separate files or classes to improve code organization and maintainability. Create a Ticker class for ticker-related operations and a separate module for input validation and error handling.
